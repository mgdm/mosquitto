# Test whether a client sends a correct PUBLISH to a topic with QoS 0, using
# the mosquitto_publish_multiple helper function.

# The client should connect to port 1888 with keepalive=60, clean session set,
# and client id publish-helper-multiple-qos0-test
# The test will send a CONNACK message to the client with rc=0. Upon receiving
# the CONNACK and verifying that rc=0, the client should send five PUBLISH messages
# to topic "publish-helper-multiple/qos0/test/$i" with payload "message" and QoS=0.
# If rc!=0, the client should exit with an error.
# After sending the PUBLISH messages, the client should send a DISCONNECT message.
